# MACsimize6

A re-implemetation of the original MACsimize script for Plasma 6.

Immitates the way OS X handles maximized and full-screened windows.

Functionality:
* The script moves full-screened and/or (fully) maximized windows to a new virtual desktop.
* When window is restored to the regular state - not full-screened and not fully maximized - the script restores (if possible) the desktops assignment of the window.
